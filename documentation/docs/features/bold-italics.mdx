title: Bold/Italic Text
---

Use `**bold**` and `*italic*` to make text **bold** and *italic*.

You may escape `**` and `*` with a backslash:
`\**bold\**` becomes `**bold**` and `\*italic\*` becomes `*italic*`.

Bold and italic text is not parsed inside of [math mode](/docs/features/math) or
[verbatim mode](/docs/features/verbatim).
