Arrows are very useful in note-taking.
Sparkdown makes it easy to write them.

The syntax is easy and intuitive:

| Arrow | Result            |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| `->`  | <ImageSwitcher darkImage={rightarrowDark} lightImage={rightarrowLight} /> |
| `=>`  | <ImageSwitcher darkImage={thickrightarrowDark} lightImage={thickrightarrowLight} /> |
| `<--`  | <ImageSwitcher darkImage={longleftarrowDark} lightImage={longleftarrowLight} /> |
| `<==>`  | <ImageSwitcher darkImage={thicklongleftrightarrowDark} lightImage={thicklongleftrightarrowthicklight} /> |

Control the direction with `<` and `>` characters.
Control the width with `-` and `=` characters.
Control the length with the number of `-` and `=` characters.
