title: Verbatim Text
---

Verbatim text is simply text that is passed through as-is.

Start and end a verbatim block by using three backticks:

    ```
    This is verbatim text.
    ```

Which outputs:

    This is verbatim text.

You may also use verbatim inline, with the vertical pipe.

:::note

This is different from the original markdown syntax! Don't forget!

:::

    This line contains |verbatim| text.

Which outputs:

This line contains `verbatim` text.
