title: Lists

Sparkdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

```md
## Ordered list:

1. This is the first item.
2. This is the second item.

## Unordered list:

* This is a list item.
* This is another list item.
```

Lists can even be nested:

```md
* This is a list item.
  * This is a sub-list item.
    1. List types may be mixed.
    2. Just like so.
  * Another sub-list item.
```
