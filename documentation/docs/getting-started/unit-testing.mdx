title: Unit Testing
---

Sparkdown comes with substantial unit testing for all of its components
using the popular [GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) framework.

First, if you don't have [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) installed,
[install it](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install.html).

Then, run the following command to build and run the unit tests:

```bash
# First, cd into the `src` directory.
[sparkdown-release-0.1.0] $ cd src/
# Now, run the unit tests.
[src] $ bazel test //...
```

If you want to run specific tests, you can do so by passing the names
or being more specific with the command:

```bash
[src] $ bazel test //lexer/lexers/...
```

:::warning

Sparkdown is still considered a work in progress; as such, breaking changes are frequent and may occur at any time.

Furthermore, the codebase does not build at this time (last updated 18 October, 2021).
