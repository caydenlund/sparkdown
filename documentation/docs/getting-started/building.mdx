title: Building Sparkdown
---

## Install Bazel

[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) is the first thing that you need.

Bazel is the open-source build tool developed by Google that simplifies
the process of scaffolding and scaling large applications.

Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install.html) to install Bazel.
On Linux, you can install Bazel from your package manager.

Bazel will manage all other external dependencies; nothing else needs to be done.

## Download the most recent version of Sparkdown

You can download the most recent release of Sparkdown from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/shrimpster00/sparkdown/releases).

Alternatively, clone the repository [from GitHub](https://github.com/shrimpster00/sparkdown) and build the most recent commit.

:::caution

Sparkdown is still considered a work in progress; as such, breaking changes are frequent and may occur at any time.

Furthermore, the codebase does not build at this time (last updated 18 October, 2021). Only clone the repository if you know what you are doing!

:::

## Build Sparkdown

```bash
# First, cd into the `src` directory.
[sparkdown-release-0.1.0] $ cd src/
# Next, build the toolkit.
[src] $ bazel build //sparkdown
# After that, Sparkdown has been built. The binaries are located in the `bazel-bin/` directory.
```

## Install Sparkdown (optional)

Installing Sparkdown is optional, but it makes it easy to use Sparkdown from the command line.

The following instructions are relevant for UNIX and UNIX-like systems:

```bash
# First, cd into the `bazel-bin/sparkdown` directory.
[src] $ cd bazel-bin/sparkdown
# If we are installing for the user:
[sparkdown] $ cp sparkdown ~/.local/bin
# Alternatively, we can install system-wide:
[sparkdown] $ sudo cp sparkdown /usr/local/bin
```
