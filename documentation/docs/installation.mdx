## Install Bazel

Sparkdown is built with [Bazel](https://bazel.build/),
the open-source build tool developed by Google that simplifies
the process of scaffolding, scaling, building and testing large applications.

Follow the
[installation instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install.html)
to install Bazel. On Linux, you can install it from your package manager.

Bazel's documentation is quite thorough, and the installation instructions
are not covered here.

Bazel will manage all other external dependencies relevant to Sparkdown;
nothing else needs to be done.

## Download the most recent version of Sparkdown

You can download the most recent release of Sparkdown from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/shrimpster00/sparkdown/releases).

Alternatively, clone the repository
[from GitHub](https://github.com/shrimpster00/sparkdown)
and build the most recent commit.

:::caution

Sparkdown is still considered a work in progress; as such,
breaking changes are frequent and may occur at any time.

Furthermore, the codebase does not build at this time
(last updated 18 October, 2021).

:::

## Build Sparkdown

```bash
# First, cd into the `src` directory.
[sparkdown-release-0.1.0] $ cd src/
# Next, run the build command.
[src] $ bazel build //sparkdown
```

After that, Sparkdown has been built.
The relevant binaries are placed in the `src/bazel-bin/sparkdown` directory.

At the time of writing (18 October, 2021), Sparkdown does not come with
an install script. However, you can still add the binaries
to your `PATH` and use them from there.
On UNIX and UNIX-like systems,
convenient locations for binaries include `~/.local/bin/`
(to install for the current user) and `/usr/local/bin/`
(to install system-wide).

```bash title="Linux and UNIX systems"
# If we are installing for the user:
[src] $ cp bazel-bin/sparkdown/sparkdown ~/.local/bin/
# Alternatively, we can install system-wide:
[src] $ sudo cp bazel-bin/sparkdown/sparkdown /usr/local/bin/
```

## Run the unit tests

Sparkdown contains a host of unit tests that use the popular
[GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) testing framework.

Bazel makes it very straightforward to run the unit tests; the command
will automatically fetch the GoogleTest library, compile
the necessary binaries, and run the tests.

```bash
# To run all tests,
[src] $ bazel test //...
# Alternatively, you can place further restrictions on the tests.
[src] $ bazel test //lexer/...
```
